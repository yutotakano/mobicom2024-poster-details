## Overview

Leveraging the public cloud for the Core Network (CN) remains uncommon amongst mobile network operators, despite the economical and operational benefits. The drive to "cloud-native", through advancements in mobile core architecture research and standard evolution have made the case stronger.

We believe that there are four types of challenges inhibiting this adoption: (1.) Jurisdictional regulations, (2.) Cost Transparency, (3.) Safety and Control, and (4.) 3GPP \& SLA compliance. In addition, all of the aforementioned challenges apart from (1) require in-depth observability, which would be hard to achieve without direct control of the hardware.

While some past works have analyzed limited aspects of these challenges [[1]], our findings are the first to provide a holistic analysis of the public cloud in comparison to on-site mobile core deployments. Our findings show the technical and economical feasibility, and lay the ground for further adoption of the public cloud.

## Challenges

The following is a diagram illustrating the challenges inhibiting the adoption of the public cloud for 5G CNs. This matches industry survey results [[2]].

## Deployment Methods

<div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full">
  <div class="flex-1 min-w-[16rem]">
    <h3 class="mb-3">1. Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) with Fargate instances</h3>
    <p>
    EKS is AWS's managed Kubernetes control-plane. Fargate is AWS's compute engine technology for cloud-native software, which runs each container in its own ephemeral micro VM. The equivalent on GCP and Azure are "Cloud Run" and "Container Apps". EKS costs $0.1/hour, and Fargate costs $0.0133/vCPU/hour for compute and $0.00147/GB/hour for memory respectively.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-1 min-w-[16rem]">
    <h3 class="mb-3">2. EKS with Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances</h3>
    <p>
    EKS can be configured to use standard EC2 VMs for container scheduling too. EC2 costs vary largely, but for CPU-bound software like the CN, machines like `t3.medium` at $0.0418 for 2 vCPU and 4 GB memory is enough.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-1 min-w-[16rem]">
    <h3 class="mb-3">3. Self-managed Kubernetes on EC2 instances</h3>
    <p>
    One can also host their own Kubernetes control-plane within a EC2 VM too, and manage its configuration entirely themselves.
    </p>
  </div>

## Cost Efficiency Validation

<div class="w-full" set:html={vcpus} />

The compute (vCPU) usage per worker pod under a load of 100 connected UEs shows that Fargate instances are not efficient in their resource use.

※ Note that the EC2 results apply for both EKS and Self-Managed control plane deployments.

## SLA Conformance Validation

<div class="w-full" set:html={latencies} />

The control-plane message processing latency shows Fargate as being unacceptably slow and inconsistent w.r.t the allowed end-to-end latency.

※ Note that the EC2 results apply for both EKS and Self-Managed control plane deployments.

## Future Work

- **Observability Solution.** Underpinning all the challenges featured in our work is `Observability', the ability to monitor the state of each and automatically or manually act. Our future work is to propose a software solution to improve observability in cloud-native CN software specifically for public cloud use cases.
- **Dataplane Feasibility.** The dataplane is subject to stricter latency and reliability requirements than the control plane. Further work is required to determine the feasibility of the public cloud for the dataplane, and otherwise design architectures to overcome any challenges.
